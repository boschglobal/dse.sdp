## Usage

> Hint: Codespaces is known to work with Chrome and Edge browsers. Firefox may prevention operation via Firefox's Setting "Enhanced Tracking Protection" (try setting to Standard to resolve the issue).


### Examples

* [Open Loop Simulation Example](examples/openloop/README.md)
* [Notebook Based Simulation Example](examples/notebook/README.md)


### Running ModelC Example Simulations

Start a Codespace, then type the following commands in the terminal window.

```bash
# Check your environment.
$ dse-env
DSE_SIMER_IMAGE=ghcr.io/boschglobal/dse-simer:latest
DSE_MODELC_VERSION=2.1.14

# Setup the examples (will download ModelC examples).
$ make examples
$ ls out/examples/modelc/
benchmark/  binary/  extended/  gateway/  gdb/  minimal/  ncodec/  runtime/  simer/  transform/

# Run a simulation using Simer.
$ dse-simer out/examples/minimal
```

> Hint: Find more information about the Simer [command options here](https://boschglobal.github.io/dse.doc/docs/user/simer/#options).


### Connect a Remote Gateway Model to a Simulation running in Cloudspace

A Cloudspace can forward ports to allow remote connections to services running in that Cloudspace.
In particular these scenarios exist:

1. Cloudspace running in a Web Browser: ports are forwarded via HTTP endpoints (i.e. URLs). This is not suitable for Simer based simuations as there is no support for HTTP endpoints (at this time).
2. Cloudspace running in VS Code: ports are forwarded to local host. Local applications can connect to these ports and acces services running in the Cloudspace. This **is** suitable for Simer based simulations.

#### Connect VS Code to a Cloudspace

> Hint: Start the Codespace in a Web Browser first, then connect to the running Codespace from VS Code.

1. Start VS Code, refresh the Remote Explorer, select Github Codespaces (from the dropdown).
2. Add a Codespace for the repo; https://github.com/boschglobal/dse.sdp ; you will need to authenticate the connection to GitHub and the Repo.
3. Connect to the Codespace.
4. Open a Terminal.


#### Run the ModelC Gateway Example Simulation

__Local WSL__
```bash
# Build a local version of the ModelC library for Windows (or download).
$ git clone https://github.com/boschglobal/dse.modelc
$ cd dse.modelc
$ PACKAGE_ARCH=windows-x64 make
```

__Cloudspace Terminal__
```bash
# Check your environment.
$ dse-env
DSE_SIMER_IMAGE=ghcr.io/boschglobal/dse-simer:latest
DSE_MODELC_VERSION=2.1.14

# Build the examples and start the Gateway Example.
$ make examples

# Run the simulation, in **host** network mode, selecting the **local** stack only.
$ dse-simer-host out/examples/modelc/gateway/ -stack local
```

> Note: The port mapping (under PORTS tab) may be different if the local port was already in use. Note the forwarded address.

__Local Powershell__
```
# Locate the Gateway example, adjust the gateway.yaml file for the mapped port if necesary.
PS> cd working\dse.modelc\dse\modelc\build\_out\examples\gateway

# Run the Gateway.

### Generate an AST from a Simulation defined in the DSE DSL

> Definitions:<br/>
  AST : Abstract Syntax Tree<br/>
  DSL : Domain Specific Language

Start a Codespace, then type the following commands in the terminal window.

```bash
# Build and install the DSE DSL Parser.
$ cd dsl
$ make
$ make install

# Parse one of the sample Simulations written in the DSE DSL and generate an AST.
$ dse-parse2ast examples/dsl/single_fmu.dse single_fmu.json
parse2ast
---------
Version: devel
Parameters:
  input_file = examples/dsl/single_fmu.dse
  output_file = single_fmu.json
Read from file: examples/dsl/single_fmu.dse
Parsing ...
Writing to file: single_fmu.json

# Use some test scripts to review the generated AST.
$ sh tests/scripts/ast_stats.sh single_fmu.json

## Developer Notes

### Dev Containers Extension for VS Code and WSL

> Note: Dev Containers is not supported by VS Codium (workarounds may still exist).

#### Install VS Code Extensions

1. Install the Dev Containers extension (Ctrl-Shift-X, then search "Dev Containers").

2. Install the WSL extension (Ctrl-Shift-X, then search "WSL").

3. Install the Codespaces extension (Ctrl-Shift-X, then search "Codespace").

4. From the Remote Explorer, select a WSL Target and then click `Connect in New Window`. A new VS Code editor will open.

5. Press `F1` to bring up the Command Palette and type `Dev Containers reopen`. You may be prompted to install docker into WSL. Even if already installed, proceed to install Docker again (in your WSL)


WSL indicator shows in the bottom left corner of the VS Code window.
The Remote Explorer, added by the WSL extension, will show available WSL Targets.


#### Start VS Code with a WSL Target (and DevContainer)

**Using WSL Bash Terminal:**

```bash
# Open a new VS Code editor connected to this repo.
cd ~/git/workspace/dse.sdp
code.

# In VS Code, press `F1` and type `Dev Containers reopen`.

# Open a bash terminal to access the DevContainer (i.e. local Codespace).
codespace ➜ /workspaces/dse.sdp (main) $ which task
/usr/local/bin/task
codespace ➜ /workspaces/dse.sdp (main) $
```

**Using VS Code:**

1. Click (bottom left) `Open a Remote Window`, then command `Connect to WSL`.

2. From the _Remote Explorer_, select a _WSL Target_ and then click `Connect in Current Window`.<br/>
  A new VS Code editor will open.

3. Select `Open Folder` and naviage to your dse.sdp repo. Previouly opened repos will be listed in the _Remote Explorer_.


After that, the container will build ... and eventually you will have the Codespace avaiable in your Terminal Window.


### Proxy Setup when running _inside_ a DevContainer

https://docs.docker.com/engine/cli/proxy/

~/git/working/dse.sdp$ cat ~/.docker/config.json
